madman writing on the wall says
"1 knock, wrong way"
"2 knocks, try again"
"3 knocks, run"

then you're trying to find your way out of a maze, probably hotel hallways, where every junction point is symmetrical and a 4 way intersection and your footsteps are really loud, as well as some other red herring noises like hotel doors creaking, you have to randomly guess which turns to make and listen, if you guess correctly you hear no knocks. If you guess wrong once you hear 1 knock on the wall and you're supposed to turn back and try again at the same intersection, if you guess wrong again you'll hear 2 knocks meaning you chose the wrong way a 2nd time. Now as long as you can remember which 3 you've ruled out (one you came from, and the 2 you tried) you should be able to get the right path this time, but its all symmetrical so hopefully easy to get mixed up, if you take the wrong turn again you hear 3 knocks and then have a second to run/hide before you hear this sound of running footsteps coming up stairs and down hallways towards you
